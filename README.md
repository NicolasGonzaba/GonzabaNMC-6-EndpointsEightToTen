Mini Challenge Eight to Ten

I Designed 3 controllers with designated services inside an API. the first controller was magic 8 ball that would give a randomized answer to any question, the second controller was anumber guesser with had 3 endpoint for 3 different difficulties each of ehich would tell the user if the number guessed was higher or lower than the correct number, The third controller allowed the user to input a food category and would randomly genrate a restuarant of that category. Additionally all endpoints checked for data validation.

Peer Review: (Daniel Herrera)
Your endpoints work properly and your input validation is spot on! I would suggest you have your restaurant category options displayed within the route for the purpose of this assignment. The namings of your route path is excellent and easy to read! Well Done!
